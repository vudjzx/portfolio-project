            This one is my favorite, I already had a clear idea on what I wanted to build and all the tools necessary to build it. The first thing was to find a movie information API and I used themoviedb.org to help me get all the information I wanted to display to the user. You can look at the trending movies and series, you can also browse thru movies/series and filter them based on genre so you get a more accurate recommendation, in addition, you can do a keyword search to find movies or series related to the search text.
            For this project I used the following technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React/React hooks and Material UI components.
